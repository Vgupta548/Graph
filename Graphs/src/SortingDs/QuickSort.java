/*
 * Worst Case: theta(n2)
 *  when the array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Following is recurrence for worst case.

 T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + \theta(n)
which is equivalent to  
 T(n) = T(n-1) + \theta(n)
 The solution of above recurrence is \theta(n2).

Best Case:  \theta(nLogn
The best case occurs when the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot. Following is recurrence for best case.

 T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \theta(n)
 
 Average Case:O(nLogn)
T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + \theta(n)

 * 
 * 
 * QuickSort is faster in practice, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, 
 * and in most real-world data. QuickSort can be implemented in different ways by changing the choice of pivot,
 *  so that the worst case rarely occurs for a given type of data. However, 
 *  merge sort is generally considered better when data is huge and stored in external storage.
 * 
 * 
 * In 3 Way QuickSort, an array arr[l..r] is divided in 3 parts:
a) arr[l..i] elements less than pivot.
b) arr[i+1..j-1] elements equal to pivot.
c) arr[j..r] elements greater than pivot.


Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesnâ€™t require any extra storage)
 whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. 


In case of linked lists the case is different mainly due to difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists.
